## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ensure that git is installed on your machine. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Docker is used for the backend and database setup. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-TutorAI-project/tutor-service.git
cd TutorAI
```

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_openai_api_key'
MONGODB_URI = 'your_secret_key'
```

Optionally, you can add the following environment variables to customize the project:

```bash
GPT_MODEL = 'gpt-3.5-turbo' # OpenAI model to use
```


### Usage
To start Tutor-Service, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To access the backend, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Generate Documentation Site

To build and preview the documentation site locally, run:

```bash
mkdocs build; mkdocs serve
```

This will build the documentation and starts a local server at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) where you can browse the docs and API reference.

## Testing
To run all the tests, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:
```bash
docker compose run backend python manage.py test --parallel
```
