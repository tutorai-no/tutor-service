# Document Processing Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully merged retrieval-service functionality into aksio-backend, implementing a complete document processing pipeline with real-time streaming capabilities and knowledge graph extraction.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Services
- **Neo4j Client** (`core/neo4j_client.py`): Database client for knowledge graph operations
- **Embedding Service** (`document_processing/embedding_service.py`): Text embedding generation using SentenceTransformers or OpenAI
- **Knowledge Graph Service** (`document_processing/knowledge_graph_service.py`): LLM-based graph extraction using LangChain and GPT-3.5
- **Scraper Client** (`document_processing/scraper_client.py`): Interface to scraper-service for document text extraction
- **Document Service** (`document_processing/document_service.py`): Main orchestration service with real-time streaming

### 2. Database Models
Created comprehensive models in `document_processing/models.py`:
- **DocumentUpload**: Track document uploads and processing status
- **DocumentChunk**: Store processed text chunks with metadata
- **URLUpload**: Track URL uploads and processing
- **URLChunk**: Store URL content chunks
- **ProcessingJob**: Track background processing jobs

### 3. API Endpoints
Real-time streaming endpoints in `document_processing/views.py`:
- `POST /api/v1/documents/upload/document/stream/` - Stream document upload processing
- `POST /api/v1/documents/upload/url/stream/` - Stream URL processing
- `GET /api/v1/documents/documents/{id}/status/` - Get document status
- `GET /api/v1/documents/urls/{id}/status/` - Get URL status
- `GET /api/v1/documents/graphs/{graph_id}/` - Get knowledge graph data
- `GET /api/v1/documents/documents/` - List user documents
- `GET /api/v1/documents/urls/` - List user URLs
- `GET /api/v1/documents/health/` - Health check endpoint

### 4. Real-Time Streaming Architecture
Implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates:
- Document upload progress
- Text extraction status
- Chunk processing progress
- Knowledge graph node/edge creation
- Embedding generation status
- Error handling and recovery

### 5. Database Integration
- Created and applied migrations for all document processing models
- Proper foreign key relationships to existing User and Course models
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- UUID-based primary keys for scalability

## Technical Features

### Graceful Dependency Handling
Services are designed to work with optional dependencies:
- Sentence Transformers (for embeddings)
- LangChain/OpenAI (for knowledge graph extraction)
- Neo4j (for graph storage)
- tiktoken (for token counting)

### Service Architecture
- **Microservices Communication**: Interfaces with external scraper-service
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Real-time streaming with generator functions
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of service failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress reporting for long-running operations

### Knowledge Graph Features
- **LLM-based Extraction**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent entity and relationship extraction
- **Neo4j Storage**: Persistent graph storage with proper indexing
- **Real-time Updates**: Streams graph construction as it happens
- **Deduplication**: Canonical ID generation for entity merging

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Neo4j Configuration
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password

# OpenAI Configuration (for knowledge graph extraction)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Embedding Configuration
EMBEDDING_MODEL_TYPE=sentence_transformers  # or openai
EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=all-MiniLM-L6-v2

# External Services
SCRAPER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Dependencies Added to requirements/base.txt
- `neo4j>=5.15.0,<5.16.0`
- `langchain>=0.1.0,<0.2.0`
- `langchain-openai>=0.0.5,<0.1.0`
- `langchain-core>=0.1.0,<0.2.0`
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.0,<2.3.0`
- `tiktoken>=0.5.0,<0.6.0`

## Frontend Integration

### Server-Sent Events Usage
```javascript
// Example frontend code for consuming real-time updates
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/v1/documents/upload/document/stream/');

eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    
    switch(data.event) {
        case 'document_created':
            console.log('Document created:', data.document_id);
            break;
        case 'node_created':
            updateKnowledgeGraph(data.node);
            break;
        case 'edge_created':
            updateKnowledgeGraph(data.edge);
            break;
        case 'processing_complete':
            showSuccess('Document processed successfully');
            break;
    }
};
```

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Complete service architecture implementation
- Database models and migrations
- Real-time streaming API endpoints
- Knowledge graph extraction pipeline
- Embedding generation service
- Admin interface integration
- Graceful error handling

### ⚠️ Pending (Dependency Installation)
- Full dependency installation in Docker container
