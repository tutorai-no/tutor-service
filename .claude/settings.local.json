The key property that defines a BST is the ordering property:\n\n1. **Left Subtree Property**: All nodes in the left subtree of a node contain values less than the nodes value\n2. **Right Subtree Property**: All nodes in the right subtree of a node contain values greater than the nodes value  \n3. **Recursive Property**: Both left and right subtrees are also binary search trees\n\n## Basic Operations\n\n### Search Operation\nTo search for a value in a BST:\n1. Start at the root node\n2. If the target value equals the current nodes value, return the node\n3. If the target value is less than the current nodes value, search the left subtree\n4. If the target value is greater than the current nodes value, search the right subtree\n5. If you reach a null node, the value is not in the tree\n\nTime Complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree\n- Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)\n- Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)\n\n### Insertion Operation\nTo insert a new value:\n1. Start at the root node\n2. If the tree is empty, create a new node as the root\n3. Compare the new value with the current nodes value\n4. If less, go to the left child; if greater, go to the right child\n5. When you reach a null position, insert the new node there\n\n### Deletion Operation\nDeletion is the most complex operation with three cases:\n1. **Leaf Node**: Simply remove the node\n2. **Node with One Child**: Replace the node with its child\n3. **Node with Two Children**: Replace with either the inorder predecessor (rightmost node in left subtree) or inorder successor (leftmost node in right subtree)\n\n## Tree Traversals\n\n### Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)\n- Visit left subtree\n- Visit root\n- Visit right subtree\n- **Key Property**: For BST, inorder traversal gives nodes in ascending order\n\n### Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)\n- Visit root\n- Visit left subtree  \n- Visit right subtree\n- **Use Case**: Creating a copy of the tree\n\n### Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)\n- Visit left subtree\n- Visit right subtree\n- Visit root\n- **Use Case**: Deleting the tree (delete children before parent)\n\n## Height and Balance\n\nThe height of a BST significantly affects performance:\n- **Balanced BST**: Height is O(log n), ensuring optimal performance\n- **Skewed BST**: Height approaches O(n), degrading to linear search performance\n\n### Self-Balancing Trees\nTo maintain balance, several variants exist:\n- **AVL Trees**: Height difference between subtrees â‰¤ 1\n- **Red-Black Trees**: Use coloring rules to maintain approximate balance\n- **Splay Trees**: Move frequently accessed nodes to the root\n\n## Applications\n\n1. **Database Indexing**: B-trees (generalization of BSTs) are used in database indexes\n2. **Expression Parsing**: Building abstract syntax trees\n3. **File Systems**: Directory structures\n4. **Priority Queues**: When implemented as heaps\n5. **Autocomplete Features**: Trie structures for prefix matching\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages\n\n### Advantages:\n- Efficient searching: O(log n) average case\n- Sorted order maintenance\n- Dynamic size\n- No need for pre-defined size\n\n### Disadvantages:\n- Can become unbalanced leading to O(n) operations\n- No constant-time access to elements by index\n- Additional memory overhead for storing pointers\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\nWhen implementing BSTs, consider:\n- **Node Structure**: Typically contains data, left pointer, and right pointer\n- **Comparison Function**: How to compare different data types\n- **Memory Management**: Proper allocation and deallocation\n- **Thread Safety**: If used in concurrent environments\n- **Balancing Strategy**: Whether to use self-balancing variants\n\nUnderstanding BSTs is crucial for computer science students as they form the foundation for more advanced tree structures and algorithms.''\n\n# Create document via API\nCREATE_DOC=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/documents/ \\\n  -H \"\"Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN\"\" \\\n  -H \"\"Content-Type: application/json\"\" \\\n  -d \"\"{\n    \\\"\"course\\\"\": \\\"\"$COURSE_ID\\\"\",\n    \\\"\"name\\\"\": \\\"\"Binary Search Trees - Comprehensive Guide\\\"\",\n    \\\"\"description\\\"\": \\\"\"Detailed explanation of BST data structure, operations, and applications\\\"\",\n    \\\"\"document_type\\\"\": \\\"\"text\\\"\",\n    \\\"\"extracted_text\\\"\": \\\"\"$DOCUMENT_CONTENT\\\"\",\n    \\\"\"processing_status\\\"\": \\\"\"completed\\\"\",\n    \\\"\"word_count\\\"\": 500\n  }\"\")\n\nDOC_ID=$(echo $CREATE_DOC | grep -o ''\"\"id\"\":\"\"[^\"\"]*\"\"'' | head -1 | cut -d''\"\"'' -f4)\necho \"\"Document created with ID: $DOC_ID\"\"\necho \"\"Document contains comprehensive BST content for flashcard generation\"\"\n\n# Store document ID for later use\necho \"\"export DOCUMENT_ID=''$DOC_ID''\"\" >> /tmp/learning_session.env)",
